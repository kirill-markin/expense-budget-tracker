# expense-budget-tracker

## Purpose

Open-source personal finance repository focused on expense tracking, budget planning, balances, transfers, and multi-currency reporting on Postgres.

## Working rules

- Use English for code comments and documentation.
- Prefer functional programming and pure functions.
- Use classes only for connectors to external systems.
- Use strict typing across functions, variables, and collections.
- Avoid fallback logic unless explicitly requested.
- Raise explicit, actionable errors with context.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the current request.
- Prefer non-interactive terminal commands.
